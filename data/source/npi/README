Run the download_and_import.sh script to download the current corpus of
data and generate the npi.csv file which FreeMED will import on its first
run.

Beware, this file is *huge*. We're talking upwards of 3-4GB of data, so
make sure you've got both hard drive space and a cup of coffee to wait for
this whole thing to import.
