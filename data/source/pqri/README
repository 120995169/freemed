The 2006 Tax Relief and Health Care Act (TRHCA) (P.L. 109-432) required the
establishment of a physician quality reporting system, including an incentive
payment for eligible professionals who satisfactorily report data on quality
measures for covered services furnished to Medicare beneficiaries during the
second half of 2007 (the 2007 reporting period). CMS named this program the
Physician Quality Reporting Initiative (PQRI).
