20000405 -------------------------------------------------------
 * perhaps move to mcal as soon as libmcal stabilizes (this should
   be easier now that jeff is developing libmcal as well)
 * move from .php3 -> .php for the futures' sake
 * rehash generate_fixed_forms.php3 to be nice
 * XML/HL7 generation routines for billing
 * sync across installs for patients

19990708 -------------------------------------------------------
 * implement payments and billing databases, with structures
 * rehash patient database into usable form, removing all legacy
   code, symbols, etc, and redoing for current work
 * implement scheduling using vCalendar interface, so as to work
   with PalmPilots, etc
 * insurance payments related dbs and tie-ins, possibly with API
   revisions
 * clarify terms
 * begin writing man pages in separated "file" format...
 * more when I think of more...
