This is a brief HOWTO concerning language translations for FreeMED using
GNU gettext. Please consult the GNU's page (http://www.gnu.org/) concerning
gettext if you have any other questions.

INITIAL TRANSLATION-------------------------------------------------------

First, fetch a CVS version of po/freemed.pot from the CVS repository. There
are instructions on how to do this on the project page on sourceforge, at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/freemed/ .

Copy this file from po/freemed.pot to (language).po . Please note that
(language) is the two letter abbreviation for your language.

Examples:
	es = Espagnole
	de = Deutche
	et cetera

You can then use either a text editor or a tool like poEdit
(http://poedit.sourceforge.net/), which works under both Linux and Windows.

If you choose to use a text editor, be sure to put the translations in
the msgstr fields, not in the msgid fields.

Send this translation to dr_gnu@ourexchange.net or jeff@ourexchange.net so
that it is included in the distribution. Please ZIP or tarball it prior
to transmission.

REVISED TRANSLATIONS------------------------------------------------------

This is a bit trickier than initial translations. You have to take your
old translation ((language).po) and combine it with the new po template
(po/freemed.pot) in the repository. You have to have GNU gettext installed
on your system to be able to revise translations.

First, grab the new version of the template from the repository, as
explained above.

Then use msgmerge to combine them, like so (example for Espagnole):
	msgmerge freemed.pot es.po > new.po

The new file that is created should have all of your previous translations
and blank fields for the new phrases to be translated. You can move
new.po to replace your old .po file when you are satisfied that it was
properly merged.
