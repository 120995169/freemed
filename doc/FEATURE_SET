--------------------------------------------------------------------------- API
* freemed has a fully featured API for future module coders to work with, and
  passes parameters in an interoperable way.
* freemed also has a seperate API for calendaring and scheduling functions,
  including an appointment interference map for minimum SQL server load.
* freemed has a loadable module API, gained from use of the phpwebtools
  toolkit, which allows extra functionality to be dropped into the program
  without having to change any part of the existing code, as is done in
  dynamic modules for C code. Binary-only modules can be used by freemed, if
  the Zend Compiler (available at http://www.zend.com/) is used.

------------------------------------------------------------ COMMUNITY INTEREST
* we have had over 10,000 hits to our main page since the site gained a web
  counter. over 6000 of those were from freshmeat.net, one of the Linux
  community's main software announcement points.
* people from all over the world coming from both english and non-english
  speaking countries have been pledging their support to the project, both in
  code/translations and testing.
* the people at Merallis.Net, one of the United States' larger medical
  insurance claim submission organizations have expressed interest in working
  out a direct interchange format, as an alternative to the proprietary and
  insecure MSIE-only Active-X method that is in use now.

--------------------------------------------------- DB MANAGEMENT AND STRUCTURE
* relational database provides for supreme customization
* "stock" or "shipping" databases allow docs to get up and running without
  having to worry about customizing everything.
* virtual 3D SQL tables allow for "folding out" of data, to limit the spread
  of related subtables.

-------------------------------------------------------------- LANGUAGE SUPPORT
* freemed has the capacity for multiple ISO set language compatibility
  (currently only the ISO-8859-x sets are implemented)
* language support is built into every module, with shared definitions for
  multiple modules -- language support is as easy as a quick translation
* languages for use are selectable at login -- half your staff can speak
  English, and the other half French, Italian, Spanish, etc, and it is still
  possible to let them work in their native languages.
* GNU gettext support is used, allowing drop-in translations for different
  locales in a standards-based, easy-to-edit format.

---------------------------------------------------------------- LEARNING CURVE
* we believe that the learning curve on a "point-and-click" web-based
  application is much easier for current and new medical management users.
  the structure allows for intuitive moving from point A to point B, with
  minimal mess. even hotkeys are partially implemented, for those who
  prefer legacy system-type shortcuts.
* using the common API interface gives a consistant look to the package,
  which decreases learning time.
* a comprehensive multi-lingual help system is built into freemed, providing
  the framework for detailed help screens during almost any portion of the
  program.

------------------------------------------------------------- PHYSICIAN CENTRIC
* freemed has and is being designed by a team of physicians from all over
  the world along with database and coding experts, to create a system that
  has the physician's needs in mind instead of insurance companies,
  providing physicians with the tools that they need and want to be able to
  serve their patients in the most efficient and helpful way possible.
* separate menus and forms are being designed for physicians' special needs
  apart from office staff. instead of being just another user on the system,
  you immediately can have all of the current pertinant information that
  the system has to offer at your fingertips.
* the system is based on Episodes of Care, which can range from one visit to
  an entire lifetime, which offers an alternative to the billing-centric
  ailment/incident type workings of most other Medical Management suites.
* being browser based, freemed is compatible with most Voice Dictation systems
  and can even run on a Palmtop PC.

------------------------------------------------------------------- SCALABILITY
* freemed was designed from the bottom up to be scalable from a single doctor
  single practice setup to a multiple hospital setup.
* multiple freemed servers can be located on the same box for lower
  equipment purchase price.
* the SQL server can be any one of many free and commercial SQL servers,
  including, but not limited to, MySQL, mSQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL
  Server, etc..

---------------------------------------------------------------------- SECURITY
* full http/https switchable support
* MD5 password encryption for higher security
* cookie time expiration for decreased risk of attacks at unattended terminals
* the SQL server can be on a separate box from the web server, allowing for
  safe firewalling of data from outside attacks
* VPN or PPTP capable networking (Virtual Private Networking)
