freemed project changelog

* Mon Dec 11 2000 rufustfirefly
  - increased version number to 0.2.0-20001211 (CVS version)
  - moved in gettext and bcmath module detection into global.var.inc to 
    stem the run on list questions 
  - commited procedure.php3 with wizard code. due to recompiling PHP on my
    box without bcmath support by mistake, can't check it for problems.

* Wed Dec 6  2000 fforest
  - billing_functions : new menu item to generate patient invoices
  - generate_fixed_forms : when doing the join on payrec and procrec we inadvertantly selected 
    procedures that where already marked as billed. 
    procamtallowed now considered in calculating total charges if it's not zero else use the original procedure charge.
    added new actions of invoice and geninvoice to selected all procedures/payments transferred to patient. this is the start
    of patient invoice billing.
  - manage_payment_records : fix display of procedure code. insert a new payrec of type rebill if a transfer or denial
    is rebilled. this will now show on the patient ledger for tracking rebills.
    during a payment transfer the OLD payrec was being updated where the selected procedure id matches the payrec id. 
    this should have been the selected procedure id matching the payrec payrecproc,this patient and payrectype of PROCEDURE.
  - manage_bills : now informs the user is ANY unpaid procedures have NOT been billed.
