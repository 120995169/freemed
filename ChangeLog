    module.php added include for billing_module
    facility module added code to grab new psrpos from pos table
    payment module did some I18n work
    procedure module pulled all proctos references. now in cpt table.
     NOTE proctos was never added to procrec!
    freemed.pot po work for payment module

* Sun Feb 11 2001 fforest
    added generate_edi to the billing functions to make it easier to
    test the edi generator under freemed. the actual code is not
    in cvs at this time so the link will be broken for others!!.
    generate_fixed_forms. moved the bill type to payrecsource from
       payreclink for the billed ledger entry. paylink should
       eventually point to the recordid of the payer we billed.
        (do that later)
    API.php stripslashes from the facility name that appears on logon sceen.
	so that "Moe's Medical Center" displayed correctly.
    containers.php.  Added remaining fields to Payer class. Added comments on
	 how we gather up payer/guar/insurer info in the patient class. added 2
	 new get functions for Patient class. IsureeresByType and InsurerID

    payment_module. now uses proccharges and procamtpaid as debit/credit
     buckets. when the procrec is updated the procbalcurrent is recalculated
     each time. this now stays in sync with the ledger. added proccharges field
     to proc summary. added option from summary screen to view Closed (paid) procedures
     to allow ledger viewing of paid accounts. added option Ledger so the ledger can be viewed
     for all procedures.
     Use the new functions added to containers.
     payrecsource for payments and transfer were using the id's instead of the
	 type (0-4) of payer. consolidated some wizard pages where the 2nd page
	 only asked for a description. moved descrip to first page. (makes the
	 process faster for the user) Documented the ledger transactions in
	 README.tablesA
    procedure_module  turned of the debugging code since it seems to be working
	 now.
    module_emr and module_maint user $form_vars instead of $this->form_vars

	Applied a fix to all modules using the notebook to run the $variables
	array and put the variables in global scope prior to the extract function
	being called. this fixes the problem for modform where if there is exiting
	data in the table it will be displayed.

  - billing_functions : new menu item to generate patient invoices
  - generate_fixed_forms : when doing the join on payrec and procrec we inadvertantly selected 
    procedures that where already marked as billed. 
    procamtallowed now considered in calculating total charges if it's not zero else use the original procedure charge.
    added new actions of invoice and geninvoice to selected all procedures/payments transferred to patient. this is the start
    of patient invoice billing.
  - manage_payment_records : fix display of procedure code. insert a new payrec of type rebill if a transfer or denial
    is rebilled. this will now show on the patient ledger for tracking rebills.
    during a payment transfer the OLD payrec was being updated where the selected procedure id matches the payrec id. 
    this should have been the selected procedure id matching the payrec payrecproc,this patient and payrectype of PROCEDURE.
  - manage_bills : now informs the user is ANY unpaid procedures have NOT been billed.
