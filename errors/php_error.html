Hello Intrepid User! <BR>
       If this is all you see (if there is no login screen far above this)<BR>
       Then you have successfully gotten Apache to work, but not PHP!! <BR>
       FreeMED requires that you have PHP and PHP-Mysql to run <BR>

       This is the index.html, but you need to view index.php as the default...
