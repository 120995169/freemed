Welcome to <B>FreeMED</B>, the world's premiere web-based
open-source practice management and electronic medical
record software!
<P>
The main menu is the center of <B>FreeMED</B>'s navigation. From
here, you can use access any part of the <B>FreeMED</B>
software.

	<LI><I>Administration Menu</I> - If you have administrator access
	to <B>FreeMED</B>, you'll see this menu. It allows you to
	add and remove users, modify <B>FreeMED</B>'s global
	configuration, and perform actions involving the database. If
	this is your first time running <B>FreeMED</B> as an
	administrator, you have to go to this menu and initialize
	the database, or else <B>FreeMED</B> will be unable to
	function properly.

	<LI><I>Billing Functions</I> - The entire billing interface of
	<B>FreeMED</B> is available via this menu. Some functions
	reqiure a patient to already be selected before using these
	functions.

	<LI><I>Call In</I> - Call-ins are available for potential
	patients who call for an appointment, but have a possibility
	of not showing up. This is useful if you don't want to fill up
	your patient database with people who you might not see in 
	the office.

	<LI><I>Database Functions</I> - If you can see this menu, you
	have access to some of <B>FreeMED</B>'s lower-level functions.
	With this menu, you can modify the internal workings,
	catalogs, and listings that make <B>FreeMED</B> work.

	<LI><I>Patient Functions</I> - This is the EMR, and all
	patient EMR functions are available via this menu. Some
	skins have a patient history on the left hand bar which
	allow you to simply select a recently viewed patient to
	view without having to reselect them.

	<LI><I>Reports</I> - This controls the report modules. More
	reports can be added by contacting your system administrator,
	or you can use Query Maker or the Custom Records portion
	of <B>FreeMED</B>.

	<LI><I>Calendar</I> - These are the calendar bits.

	<LI><I>Logout of FreeMED</I> - This will log you out of
	<B>FreeMED</B>. Please remember to log out if you will be
	away from your computer for an extended period of time.
