FreeMED's episode of care concept allows physicians and providers to
analyze patient illness and treatments patterns. In contrast to
incident-based EMR tracking, episodes of care can span from a single
visit to a patient's lifetime.

<P>

Incident-based tracking assigns an "incident" to every time a patient
is seen by a physician or provider. This works in some cases, but does
not allow the system to connect separate visits with a treatment plan
or overally problem.
