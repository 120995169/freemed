The main patient selection screen allows you to select a patient based on
a wide range of criteria. The "Show All Patients" link is provided only when
the number of patients in the system is very small, as large numbers of
patients produce prohibitively large pages to scroll through.

<UL>Patient Selection Methods

	<LI><I>Patients by Name</I> - Displays all patients whose last name
	start with the specified letter. This works well in smaller practices,
	but may become a problem in larger settings, where its use is
	strongly discouraged.

	<LI><I>Patients Field Search</I> - Allows searching on a patient's
	vital information (name, address, et cetera). It currently searches
	on a <ABBR TITLE="portion of the full text">substring</DEFN> for
	any of the pieces of patient information listed in its dropbox.

	<LI><I>Soundalike Search</I> - Searches via a
	<ABBR TITLE="mathematical representation of a words' pronunciation"
	>soundex</ABBR> key any of the fields listed in its dropbox.
