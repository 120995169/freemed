<h2> Purpose </h2>
<p>
The goal of the freemed formulary module is to allow members
of a prescribing organization to
integrate the best possible drug information into their
practice of medicine.
We hope to provide prescribers the tools to go beyond the HMO 
formulary concept, whose aim is
to steer prescribers to write scripts for a narrow range
of approved drugs. 
The format is not yet finalized and is open to suggestions.
</p>
<h2> Contents of the Formulary Table </h2>
<p>
The formulary contains prescription drug information in a
table format.  The first column is the name of the drug class,
the most general category.  Drug classes may vary for each
prescribing organization.  Example classes are nsaid (non-
steroidal anti-inflammatory), acei (angiotensin I-converting enzyme
inhibitor), etc.
</p>
<p>
The next column contains the generic name of the drug, followed
by the trademarked name of the drug, which varies according
to the manufacturer.  This may also vary according to formulations.
</p>
<p>
The following three fields are for indications.  This may not
be an exhaustive list.  (Pointer to another table in the third
field?)
</P>
<h2>Navigating the Formulary Table</h2>
<p>
