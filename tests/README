--------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains regression tests for the different FreeMED
APIs as per the changes which are present in the move from the 
0.8.x API to the 0.9.x+ API.

By default these tests are not available through Apache, as there is
an .htaccess file preventing access for security reason. Please run
them using the PHP CLI binary.
