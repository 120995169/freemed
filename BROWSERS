Alphabetic listing of browsers (browser, platform, notes,
 date) --------------------------------------------------

Internet Explorer v4.01 SP1 [Win98] - Works fine. We
  initially thought there was a problem, but determined
  it to be a time skew. (19990615)

Internet Explorer v5.0 [Win98] - Seems to work fine. Done
  by Scott at zirmed.com (19991119)

KFM v1.1.1 [Linux/KDE] - Has some rendering problems, but
  basic authentication seems to work fine. Needed to have
  some string for $_auth, or it would build the URL
  incorrectly. (19990615)
  * Damn thing crashes unpredictably, due to its crappy
  rendering. Perhaps this has a chance of working again by
  1.1.2. Expired my stupid cookies for no reason. 
  (19990708)
  * As of 19990803, for some reason, everything works
  absolutely flawlessly. I wonder when the pendulum will
  fall... (19990803)

Lynx v2.8.1 [Linux] - Works well, doesn't seem to have any
  known problems. Please note that this browser is TEXT
  BASED. (19990615)

Mozilla M8 w/Talkback 19990716 [Linux] - The rendering
  looks fine under KDE, but the GNOME snapshot they had was
  even prettier. I'll have to figure out how to make
  _mine_ look that pretty. (19990716)

Netscape Communicator v4.6 [Linux] - Seems to work as well
  as anything. This was the primary test platform for the
  program. (19990615)
  * v4.61 Update -- Crashes occur about 1/8 as much using
  this upgrade. Still the best rendering/viewing/whatever
  for this package. (19990708)
  * v4.7 -- crashes almost gone! (19991018)

Opera v3.6 [Windows 32-bit] - functions seemingly perfectly,
  and doesn't crash as much as netscape! (19991018)

Opera v4.0a Technology Preview 2 [i386 Linux] - works well
  besides some broken things in the patient module and some
  very un-frumulent rendering. (20000126)

StarOffice Built-In Web Browser v5.1 [Linux] - Works well.
  Can log in. Rendering is dirt slow, due to the engine,
  but overall is workable. (19990615)

Voyager v4.05 [QNX Demodisk] - the tables render at 100% of
  screen width, but other than that, this single disk OS/
  web-browser with dialup or LAN connectivity is a godsend
  for the users of freemed. (19991115)
