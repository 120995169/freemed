<body>
Hello Intrepid User! <br/>
If this is all you see (if there is no login screen far above this),
then you have successfully gotten Apache to work, but not PHP.
FreeMED requires that you have PHP and PHP-MySQL to run.

<p/>

This is the index.html, but you need to view index.php as the default.

<p/>

If you have PHP installed and working already, you need to make sure that
"index.php" is the first filename listed in the <b>DirectoryIndex</b>
directive in your Apache configuration.
