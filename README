freemed documentation
from jeff b (jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu)
(c) 1999 by the freemed project under the GPL, v2

********************************************************************** ERRATA
* index.php3 has to be added in /etc/httpd/conf/?????.conf under the
  list of valid index files.
* these are to be installed in /usr/share/freemed, and a virtual directory
  alias should be made in the Apache configuration files, as well as
  giving read perms to Apache.
* if something doesn't work after you upgrade to a new tarball, please
  reinitialize the database to get the new parts up and running. (this
  will change as soon as the database is capable of holding live data)
* code is annotated with an author if the primary author is other than
  jeff b <jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu>
* since freemed involves a fairly hefty codebase, php optimizing tricks,
  such as the bware_cache module or the Zend Optimizer should be used to
  minimize load times.

**************************************************************** INSTALLATION

1) Make sure that MySQL and all of its libraries are properly installed on
   your system. If you are planning on using a MySQL server located on
   another box, be sure that the client libraries are installed on your
   freemed box.

2) Make sure that PHP is installed, with MySQL support. Linux-Mandrake
   requires a seperate module (php-mysql) for MySQL support, as do some
   versions of RedHat. Freemed currently uses PHP version 4 and above.

3) Install phpwebtools (you can download it from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpwebtools/). This library is required
   for versions of freemed starting at 0.2.0.

4) Install the freemed package:

   # cd /usr/share
   # tar zxvf /location/to/tarball/freemed-version.tar.gz

   which will extract the .tar.gz file to /usr/share/freemed/.

5) Create the phpwebtools symbolic link by:

   # cd /usr/share/freemed
   # ln -s /etc/httpd/php/webtools.php .

6) Edit the /usr/share/freemed/global.var.inc file to make sure that all
   settings are correct for your machine.

7) Edit your Apache configuration files to associate .php, .inc, and .php3
   files with php, as well as setting index.php3 to be one of the default
   indexes. Also set up access and a directory alias for freemed. This is
   accomplished with the following lines:

   DirectoryIndex index.php3 index.php (et cetera...)

   AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .phtml .php .inc

   Alias /freemed /usr/share/freemed

   <Directory "/usr/share/freemed">
     Options Indexes Includes ExecCGI MultiViews FollowSymLinks
     AllowOverride All
     Order allow,deny
     allow from all
   </Directory>

8) HUP apache (killall -1 httpd) to force it to reload its configuration
   files.

9) Try to load http://localhost/freemed/ in your web browser. If no error
   messages occur, login in as "root" with the password being your database
   password. This will bring up a version of freemed that can be used to
   setup the database structures, but little else. Go to the "Administration"
   Menu, and select "Reinitialize Database". When prompted, check the
   "First Initialization" checkbox, and then click the "Continue" button.
   Due to a fairly dumb bug, you have to go back to the Admin menu, click
   on "Reinitialize Database" *again*, but do not select "First Initialization"
   then initialize the database again, which will create the proper tables and
   information. You may now use freemed. Congratulations!

********************************************************* current coders/staff

jeff (jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu) -
  a great deal of the coding and documentation so far

dr_gnu (dr_gnu@strangelove.dyndns.org, doc@footcare.dyndns.org) -
  db management, planning, and all of those lovely tasks we all
  wish that we could be doing instead of sitting around coding
  like we had a torch under our proverbial arse.

max klohn (amk@span.ch) -
  this guy is incredible. lots of translations, fixes, and bug
  reports like you wouldn't believe, as well as things to think
  about, and many database structures...

chris beggy (chrisb@kippona.com) -
  one of the two website maintainers, as well as the admin of
  our web server, he also codes modules and helps decide
  important decision stuff.

francisco sam castillo (fsam@proyecto-web.com.mx) -
  sam does the other 1/2 of the website maintaining, and is
  responsible for the layout as well as a lot of the content.
  his other contributions have been very good, and he is
  probably going to be doing HTML scripting for the modules
  when they are ready for him.

ryan losh (rklosh@rkl.org) -
  returning to the project after a six month absence...runs a billing
  service that wants to switch from that closed source 800lb gorilla.

john gage (jgage@epo.som.sunysb.edu) -
  author of a great anesthesia tracking/report system, which as
  of 19990924 is slated to be put into the source tree... but
  you'll have to have a java enabled web-browser to use it. thems
  the breaks.
