FreeMED documentation
from jeff b (jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu)
(c) 1999-2001 by the freemed project under the GPL/LGPL

********************************************************************** ERRATA
* index.php has to be added in /etc/httpd/conf/?????.conf under the
  list of valid index files.
* These are to be installed in /usr/share/freemed, and a virtual directory
  alias should be made in the Apache configuration files, as well as
  giving read perms to Apache.
* If something doesn't work after you upgrade to a new tarball, please
  reinitialize the database to get the new parts up and running. (this
  will change as soon as the database is capable of holding live data)
* Code is annotated with an author if the primary author is other than
  jeff b <jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu>
* Since freemed involves a fairly hefty codebase, php optimizing tricks,
  such as the bware_cache module or the Zend Optimizer should be used to
  minimize load times. APC is also available (apc.communityconnect.com)

**************************************************************** INSTALLATION

1) Make sure that MySQL and all of its libraries are properly installed on
   your system. If you are planning on using a MySQL server located on
   another box, be sure that the client libraries are installed on your
   freemed box.

2) Make sure that PHP is installed, with MySQL support. Linux-Mandrake
   requires a seperate module (php-mysql) for MySQL support, as do some
   versions of RedHat. Freemed currently uses PHP version 4 and above.

3) Install phpwebtools (you can download it from
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpwebtools/). This library is required
   for versions of freemed starting at 0.2.0. FreeMED will give you a
   warning if your version of phpwebtools is too old. We try not to rely
   on a CVS version of phpwebtools for release versions of FreeMED.

4) Install the freemed package:

   # cd /usr/share
   # tar zxvf /location/to/tarball/freemed-version.tar.gz

   which will extract the .tar.gz file to /usr/share/freemed/.

5) Create the phpwebtools symbolic link by:

   # cd /usr/share/freemed
   # ln -s /etc/httpd/php/webtools.php .

6) Edit the /usr/share/freemed/lib/freemed.php file to make sure that all
   settings are correct for your machine. (There is a setup wizard in the
   works that performs this step for you, using a web browser.)

7) Edit your Apache configuration files to associate .php, .inc, and .php3
   files with php, as well as setting index.php3 to be one of the default
   indexes. Also set up access and a directory alias for freemed. This is
   accomplished with the following lines:

   DirectoryIndex index.php3 index.php (et cetera...)

   AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .phtml .php

   Alias /tmp /bills                     
   Alias /freemed /usr/share/freemed

   <Directory "/usr/share/freemed">
     Options Indexes Includes ExecCGI MultiViews FollowSymLinks
     AllowOverride All
     Order allow,deny
     allow from all
   </Directory>

8) HUP apache (killall -1 httpd) to force it to reload its configuration
   files.

9) Create the database with the command "mysqladmin -p create freemed"
   (if you are using MySQL). (The setup wizard also does this.)

10) Try to load http://localhost/freemed/ in your web browser. If no error
    messages occur, login in as "root" with the password being your database
    password. This will bring up a version of freemed that can be used to
    setup the database structures, but little else. Go to the "Administration"
    Menu, and select "Reinitialize Database". When prompted, check the
    "First Initialization" checkbox, and then click the "Continue" button.
    Due to a fairly dumb bug, you have to go back to the Admin menu, click
    on "Reinitialize Database" *again*, but do not select "First Initialization"
    then initialize the database again, which will create the proper tables and
    information. You may now use freemed. Congratulations!

********************************************************* current coders/staff

Jeff (jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu) -
  Most of the code in the codebase is Jeff's. If you have any
  problems with something non-billing related, he's probably
  the person you want to speak to.

dr_gnu (dr_gnu@ourexchange.net) -
  DB management, planning, and direction. Architectural design
  and questions should be addressed to him.

Adam (gdrago23@yahoo.com) -
  Much maintenance and general upkeep, as well as module
  conversions

Max Klohn (amk@span.ch) -
  This guy is incredible. lots of translations, fixes, and bug
  reports like you wouldn't believe, as well as things to think
  about, and many database structures...

Chris Beggy (chrisb@kippona.com) -
  One of the two website maintainers, as well as the admin of
  our web server, he also codes modules and helps decide
  important decision stuff.

Francisco Sam Castillo (fsam@proyecto-web.com.mx) -
  Sam does the other 1/2 of the website maintaining, and is
  responsible for the layout as well as a lot of the content.
  his other contributions have been very good, and he is
  probably going to be doing HTML scripting for the modules
  when they are ready for him.

Ryan Losh (rklosh@rkl.org) -
  Returning to the project after a six month absence...runs a billing
  service that wants to switch from that closed source 800lb gorilla.

John Gage (jgage@epo.som.sunysb.edu) -
  Author of a great anesthesia tracking/report system, and has been
  doing usability and capability testing for freemed.

Fred Forrester (fforest@netcarrier.com) -
  Current maintainer of the billing code. fred has done a fine job, and
  has added much functionality. as well as cleaning up some of the age-old
  code...
