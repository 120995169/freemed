ERRATA:
* index.php3 has to be added in /etc/httpd/conf/?????.conf under the
  list of valid index files.
* these are to be installed in /var/(packagename), and a virtual directory
  alias should be made in the Apache configuration files, as well as
  giving read perms to Apache.
* if something doesn't work after you upgrade to a new tarball, please
  reinitialize the database to get the new parts up and running. (this
  will change as soon as the database is capable of holding live data)

INSTALLATION:
To install, add
  Alias /package /var/package
and change the first AddType line to read (19990807):
  AddType application/x-httpd-php3 .php3 .phtml .php .inc
to your /etc/httpd/conf/srm.conf file, and
  <Directory /var/package>
  Options Indexes Includes ExecCGI MultiViews FollowSymLinks
  AllowOverride All
  Order allow,deny
  allow from all
  </Directory>
to your access.conf file. Then HUP Apache, or restart it, depending on your
religion.
(also, the lang/reg/ directory has to be set chmod o+w or else it will not
 build the language registry properly)

current coders/staff:

jeff (jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu) -
  all coding and documentation so far
dr_gnu (dr_gnu@strangelove.dyndns.org, doc@footcare.dyndns.org) -
  db management, planning, and all of those lovely tasks we all
  wish that we could be doing instead of sitting around coding
  like we had a torch under our proverbial arse.
max klohn (amk@span.ch) -
  this guy is incredible. lots of translations, fixes, and bug
  reports like you wouldn't believe, as well as things to think
  about, and many database structures...
chris beggy (chrisb@kippona.com) -
  one of the two website maintainers, as well as the admin of
  our web server, he also codes modules and helps decide
  important decision stuff.
francisco sam castillo (fsam@proyecto-web.com.mx) -
  sam does the other 1/2 of the website maintaining, and is
  responsible for the layout as well as a lot of the content.
  his other contributions have been very good, and he is
  probably going to be doing HTML scripting for the modules
  when they are ready for him.
ryan losh (rklosh@rkl.org) -
  returning to the project after a six month absence...runs a billing
  service that wants to switch from that closed source 800lb gorilla.
john gage (jgage@epo.som.sunysb.edu) -
  author of a great anesthesia tracking/report system, which as
  of 19990924 is slated to be put into the source tree... but
  you'll have to have a java enabled web-browser to use it. thems
  the breaks.
