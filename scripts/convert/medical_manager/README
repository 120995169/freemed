scripts/convert/medical_manager
documentation by jeff b (jeff@univrel.pr.uconn.edu)

This directory contains scripts to convert Medical Manager 7.1 databases/
tables into freemed's import format. These scripts are provided without
guarantee of functionality, although it would please me greatly if they
worked properly.

They require Perl 5.00x, and will not work without a proper perl interpreter,
also they have only been tested under Linux 2.2.x, so there is no guarantee
that they will work under Wintel systems, etc.
